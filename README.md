# tau v1 — archived

> **This repository is tau v1, the prototype. It is archived and read-only.**
> tau was rebooted as an agent kernel; active development lives in
> [`tau-rs/tau`](https://github.com/tau-rs/tau). v1 explored the territory;
> that tau is the kernel. Why: [ADR-0071 — tau, rebooted](docs/decisions/0071-tau-rebooted.md)
> and the [kernel-reboot handoff](docs/retrospectives/2026-09-13-kernel-reboot-handoff.md).

Everything below describes tau v1 as it stood at the reboot, unchanged.

> Tau installs and runs agents in the terminal — solo or orchestrated,
> globally or per-project — with skills, tools, MCP servers, LLM
> backends, and pipelines provided as installable packages.

**Status:** Phase 1 — runnable runtime. The package manager,
plugin-loading, three real LLM-backend plugins, two real tool plugins,
capability override, transitive dependency resolution, streaming, REPL
persistence, sandboxing (Linux + macOS), workflows, multi-agent
orchestration, and Skills are shipped or in flight. Distribution of
installable plugin packages over public URLs is the next surface to
firm up. See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for the live status.

## What tau is

Tau is a minimal, terminal-native Rust runtime. Core does four things
(G1):

1. Installs packages.
2. Runs agents (solo or orchestrated).
3. Passes messages between entities.
4. Observes what happens.

Everything domain-specific — LLM backends, tools, pipelines, skills,
MCP servers, SDKs — is a package. Core ships empty (G11).

The full charter is in [`CONSTITUTION.md`](CONSTITUTION.md). Every
decision about what tau is and how it is built defers to that
document. A one-line summary of all 59 guidelines is in
[`GUIDELINES_CHEATSHEET.md`](GUIDELINES_CHEATSHEET.md).

## What tau is not

Tau is not an LLM, not a hosted service, not a package marketplace, not
a workflow engine, not an AI safety harness, not a credential manager.
See [`CONSTITUTION.md` §2](CONSTITUTION.md) for the full list of 12
non-goals.

## Building

Bootstrap-only at the moment:

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo run -p tau-cli  # prints "tau"
```

Requires Rust 1.91 or newer (MSRV).
